# Hello, I'm Sulaiman Shirzay 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in both frontend and backend technologies. I enjoy building dynamic and responsive web applications that provide a great user experience.

## 🌐 Frontend Technologies

I have experience with various frontend technologies that help me create beautiful and interactive user interfaces:

- **HTML5**: The backbone of any web application, allowing me to structure content effectively.
- **CSS3**: I use CSS for styling and layout, including frameworks like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for advanced styling.
- **JavaScript**: The core language for client-side scripting, enhancing user interactivity.
- **React.js**: A powerful library for building user interfaces, allowing me to create reusable components and manage state efficiently. Currently, I am working on transitioning to **Next.js** for server-side rendering and improved performance.
- **UI Libraries**: I leverage various UI libraries to enhance the user experience and speed up development.

## ⚙️ Backend Technologies

On the backend, I work with various technologies to create robust and scalable server-side applications:

- **Laravel**: A PHP framework that I use for building elegant and efficient web applications.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows me to build server-side applications with ease.
- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **Django**: A high-level Python framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **TypeScript**: I use TypeScript for better code quality and maintainability in my JavaScript applications.
- **GraphQL**: I implement GraphQL for flexible and efficient data querying.

## 📈 Other Skills

- **Version Control**: Proficient in using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
